## Regex Components

Short for regular expression, a regex is a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text.

### Anchors

An anchor is a piece of text which marks the beginning and/or the end of a hypertext link. like email addresses or redirecting links.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match.

### OR Operator

An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result. such as ?,!,++

### Character Classes

classes are used to disect functions and call certain parts of the info in the functions such as in a book function separating the auther, title, and number of pages.

### Flags

a flag is a value that acts as a signal for a function or process.
you use flags when you use debuger to see the error in your code.

### Grouping and Capturing

They capture the text matched by the regex inside them into a numbered group that can be reused with a numbered backreference.

### Bracket Expressions

A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by ' [ ' and ' ] '. It matches any single character in that list.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy means your expression will match as large a group as possible, lazy means it will match the smallest group possible.

### Boundaries

The word boundary \b matches positions where one side is a word character (usually a letter, digit or underscore—but see below for variations across engines) and the other side is not a word character (for instance, it may be the beginning of the string or a space character).

### Back-references

An item in a regular expression equivalent to the text matched by an earlier pattern in the expression. it is simmular to recalling something from memory.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Lookahead allows to add a condition for “what follows”. Lookbehind is similar, but it looks behind. That is, it allows to match a pattern only if there's something before it.
